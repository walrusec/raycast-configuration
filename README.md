## Raycast Script Examples

These are example scripts setup for use within Raycast. They are stripped down versions of things I use often as a security analyst. Hopefully they provide some inspiration for you to use a launcher like Raycast.

I'm hoping to offer a starting point for you to improve your workflows with a launcher. The examples make some assumptions about the running system, such as the presence of Google Chrome, and running the scripts directory in your home directory.
